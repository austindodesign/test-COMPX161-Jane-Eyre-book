    <div class="content">

        <p>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the
            leafless shrubbery
            an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the
            cold winter
            wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor
            exercise was now
            out of the question.</p>

        <p>I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was
            the coming
            home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of
            Bessie, the
            nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana
            Reed.</p>

        <p>The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she
            lay
            reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither
            quarrelling nor
            crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, &#34;She
            regretted to be
            under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could
            discover by
            her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and
            childlike
            disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner-something lighter, franker, more natural, as
            it were-she
            really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.&#34;</p>

        <p>&#34;What does Bessie say I have done?&#34; I asked.</p>

        <p>&#34;Jane, I don&#39;t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a
            child taking
            up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain
            silent.&#34;</p>

        <p>A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon
            possessed
            myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the
            window-seat:
            gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain
            nearly
            close, I was shrined in double retirement.</p>

        <p>Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of
            glass,
            protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over
            the leaves
            of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist
            and cloud;
            near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a
            long and
            lamentable blast.</p>

        <p>I returned to my book-Bewick&#39;s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little
            for,
            generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could
            not pass
            quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of &#34;the solitary rocks
            and
            promontories&#34; by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its
            southern
            extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape-</p>


        <p class="poem">&#34;Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,</p>
        <p class="poem">Boils round the naked, melancholy isles</p>
        <p class="poem">Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge</p>
        <p class="poem">Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.&#34;</p>

        <p>Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen,
            Nova Zembla,
            Iceland, Greenland, with &#34;the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary
            space,-that
            reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters,
            glazed in
            Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme
            cold.&#34; Of
            these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended
            notions that
            float dim through children&#39;s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory
            pages
            connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing
            up alone in a
            sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and
            ghastly moon
            glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.</p>

        <p> I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed
            headstone; its gate,
            its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent,
            attesting the hour
            of eventide.</p>

        <p>The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.</p>

        <p> The fiend pinning down the thief&#39;s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of
            terror.</p>

        <p>So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a
            gallows.</p>

        <p>Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect
            feelings, yet ever
            profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter
            evenings, when she
            chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth,
            she allowed
            us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed&#39;s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
            borders, fed our
            eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other
            ballads; or (as at
            a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.</p>

        <p>With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but
            interruption, and
            that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.</p>

        <p> &#34;Boh! Madam Mope!&#34; cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently
            empty.</p>

        <p>&#34;Where the dickens is she!&#34; he continued. &#34;Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not
            here: tell
            mama she is run out into the rain-bad animal!&#34;</p>

        <p> &#34;It is well I drew the curtain,&#34; thought I; and I wished fervently he might not discover my
            hiding-place:
            nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception;
            but Eliza
            just put her head in at the door, and said at once-</p>

        <p> &#34;She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.&#34;</p>

        <p> And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said
            Jack.</p>

        <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; I asked, with awkward diffidence.</p>

        <p>&#34;Say, &#39;What do you want, Master Reed?&#39;&#34; was the answer. &#34;I want you to come here;&#34;
            and
            seating
            himself in an
            arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.</p>

        <p> John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten:
            large and stout
            for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy
            limbs and large
            extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim
            and bleared
            eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for
            a month or
            two, &#34;on account of his delicate health.&#34; Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very
            well if he
            had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother&#39;s heart turned from an opinion
            so harsh,
            and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John&#39;s sallowness was owing to
            over-application and,
            perhaps, to pining after home.</p>

        <p> John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and
            punished me;
            not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I
            had feared
            him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I
            was
            bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his
            menaces or his
            inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against
            him, and Mrs.
            Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though
            he did both
            now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind her back.</p>

        <p>Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting
            out his tongue
            at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while
            dreading the
            blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder
            if he read
            that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I
            tottered, and
            on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair.</p>

        <p> &#34;That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,&#34; said he, &#34;and for your sneaking way
            of getting
            behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!&#34;</p>

        <p>Accustomed to John Reed&#39;s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to
            endure the blow
            which would certainly follow the insult.</p>

        <p> &#34;What were you doing behind the curtain?&#34; he asked.</p>

        <p>&#34;I was reading.&#34;</p>

        <p>&#34;Show the book.&#34;</p>

        <p> I returned to the window and fetched it thence.</p>

        <p>&#34;You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your
            father left
            you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen&#39;s children like us, and eat the
            same meals
            we do, and wear clothes at our mama&#39;s expense. Now, I&#39;ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves:
            for they are
            mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of
            the way of
            the mirror and the windows.&#34;</p>

        <p> I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book
            and stand in
            act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the
            volume was
            flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled,
            the pain was
            sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.</p>

        <p> &#34;Wicked and cruel boy!&#34; I said. &#34;You are like a murderer-you are like a slave-driver-you are
            like the Roman
            emperors!&#34;</p>

        <p>I had read Goldsmith&#39;s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I
            had drawn
            parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.</p>

        <p> &#34;What! what!&#34; he cried. &#34;Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?
            Won&#39;t I
            tell mama?
            but first-&#34;</p>

        <p>He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate
            thing. I
            really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down
            my neck, and
            was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over
            fear, and I
            received him in frantic sort. I don&#39;t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me
            &#34;Rat! Rat!&#34;
            and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was
            gone upstairs:
            she now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the
            words-</p>

        <p>&#34;Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!&#34;</p>

        <p>&#34;Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!&#34;</p>

        <p>Then Mrs. Reed subjoined-</p>

        <p>&#34;Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.&#34; Four hands were immediately laid upon
            me, and I was
            borne upstairs.
