        <h1>PREFACE</h1>
        <p>
            A preface to the first edition of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; being unnecessary, I gave none: this second edition demands a
            few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.
        </p>
        <p>My thanks are due in three quarters. </p>
        <p>To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions.</p>
        <p>To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.</p>
        <p> To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have
            afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.</p>
        <p>The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my
            Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
            high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select
            Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.</p>
        <p>Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small
            one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt
            the tendency of such books as &#34;Jane Eyre:&#34; in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in
            each protest against bigotry-that parent of crime-an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would
            suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.</p>
        <p>Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail
            the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
            Thorns.</p>
        <p> These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often
            confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
            doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming
            creed of Christ. There is-I repeat it-a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
            and clearly the line of separation between them.</p>
        <p> The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it
            convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth-to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines.
            It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose-to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it-to
            penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.</p>
        <p>Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the
            sycophant son of Chenaanah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
            to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.</p>
        <p> There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking,
            comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and
            Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital-a mien as dauntless and as
            daring. Is the satirist of &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I think if some of those
            amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his
            denunciation, were to take his warnings in time-they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.
        </p>
        <p>Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect
            profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
            social regenerator of the day-as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the
            warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
            suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his
            wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
            carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation
            to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does
            to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him-if he
            will accept the tribute of a total stranger-I have dedicated this second edition of &#34;JANE EYRE.&#34;</p>

        <h1>NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h1>
        <p>
            I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; affords me, of again addressing a
            word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If,
            therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it
            is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.
        </p>
        <p>This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future
            errors. </p>
